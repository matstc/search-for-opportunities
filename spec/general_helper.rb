Bush, utilized media manipulation and strategic ambiguity to hide the human cost&nbsp;of the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.&nbsp; Media access to the battlefield has been limited to embedded journalists who must be accompanied by military personnel at all times.&nbsp; Prior to the media arriving, the scene of a&nbsp;battle is usually&nbsp;sanitized by the military to suggest that minimal US casualties have occurred, and that the operation was executed with surgical precision.&nbsp;Propaganda directed towards the American people has been&nbsp;disseminated unquestioned by the&nbsp;corporate media outlets, who more often than not, act in concert with the US government to shape public perception. Who can forget the unprecedented amount of media coverage the Jessica Lynch \"rescue\" received? I suppose&nbsp;a camera crew&nbsp;normally tags along on special forces operations, and&nbsp;draping an&nbsp;American flag across&nbsp;the chest of the person you just rescued is standard military procedure.&nbsp; Or who can forget the iconic video of American forces toppling the statue of Saddam Hussein in front of what seems to be a packed plaza of cheering spectators.&nbsp; However, a wide-angle shot of the same scene will reveal that there is only a small of group people (which many say was organized in large by the US Military) clustered together to give the impression of a packed event on a zoomed in camera.&nbsp; </p>\n<p><br />To further dehumanize the cost of war, George W. Bush banned all media coverage of the flag draped coffins of fallen US soldiers coming home from the Middle East.&nbsp; The new Obama administration has ordered a review of the policy, and it is up to us, the American voter, to let them know that the sacrifice that these brave men and women have made should not be hidden from the public and swept under the carpet.&nbsp; These fallen heroes should receive the respect they so rightly deserve, and their sacrifice&nbsp;must be a reminder to everyone&nbsp;of not only of what this country represents, but also, the consequences of unchecked political power.&nbsp; Don't let the&nbsp;achievements and memory&nbsp;of these brave souls be&nbsp;degraded by a cheap attempt&nbsp;by political forces&nbsp;to&nbsp;affect public perception by downplaying and hiding the human cost&nbsp;of war.&nbsp; The human cost of war is&nbsp;something that should always be remembered and never forgotten.</p>"}, {

Children there come mainly from Hanoi, but the school also receives children from other provinces who come there for schooling because of the school’s high training quality. At this school the children’s accommodation and schooling fees are paid for. Children are encouraged to take part in important events such as the ceremony for 35th birthday for Cooperation between Vietnam and Japan. Talented musicians from the school have also performed in France as well. There is a focus on real-life skills, children are taught massage and computer skills so that when they graduate from school they can find a job and earn a living by themselves.<br />"}, {

Despite the natural beauty of their environment they have some of the lowest standards of living, health and education in the country. Many youngpeople from these communities do not attend school and begin working at a very young age. <br /><br /><br />Project Goals:<br />Work with local ethnic minority groups to develop English language skills, improve environmental awareness, assist with natural conservation and help improve the interactions of local communities with the tourists on whom they depend. <br /><br /><br />Project Duration:<br />VFCD will organize two workcamps each month from February to December each year. Each workcamp will run for 2 weeks duration. <br /><br /><br />Workcamps in Ban Ho Village start week 1 of each month. <br />Ban Ho Village is a well developed village with a large number of homestays operating. However the village is suffering from degradation of the environment caused by large development works in the region. There is significant conservation work to be undertaken in this village, as well as assisting homestay owners and children with English language skills.<br /><br /><br />Workcamps in Ta Phin Village start week 3 of each month. <br />Ta Phin Village is comparatively under-developed. The villagers wish to improve the quality of their homestays and to improve the methods used by locals to sell handicrafts to tourists visiting the area. They also are very interested in the English language development of their children. <br /><br /><br />"}, {
